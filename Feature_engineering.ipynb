        "1. What is a parameter?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> A parameter is a model component that is learned from the training data. For example, in linear regression, the slope and intercept are parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is correlation?  \n",
        "\n",
        "->Correlation is a measure of the relationship between two variables. It ranges from -1 to +1 and shows how one variable changes with respect to another.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What does negative correlation mean?\n",
        "\n",
        "->Negative correlation means that as one variable increases, the other decreases. For example, as temperature increases, the need for blankets decreases.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Define Machine Learning. What are the main components in Machine Learning?  \n",
        "\n",
        "->Machine Learning is a field of AI where systems learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions. Its main components are data, model, loss function, optimizer, and evaluation.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. How does loss value help in determining whether the model is good or not?  \n",
        "\n",
        "->The loss value indicates how well the model is performing. A low loss means the model's predictions are close to actual values.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What are continuous and categorical variables?\n",
        "\n",
        "->Continuous variables are numeric and can take any value, like height or weight. Categorical variables represent categories, like color or gender.\n",

        "\n",
        "->Categorical variables are handled using techniques like label encoding, one-hot encoding, ordinal encoding, and target encoding.\n",

        "8. What do you mean by training and testing a dataset?  \n",
        "\n",
        "->Training a dataset means using it to teach the model. Testing a dataset means using new data to evaluate how well the model performs.\n",

        "9. What is sklearn.preprocessing?  \n",
        "\n",
        "->`sklearn.preprocessing` is a module in Scikit-learn used for data preprocessing like scaling, encoding, and imputing missing values.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is a Test set?\n",

        "11. How do we split data for model fitting (training and testing) in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "->We split data using `train_test_split()` from Scikit-learn to divide it into training and testing sets, typically with 70–80% for training and the rest for testing.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How do you approach a Machine Learning problem?  \n",
        "\n",
        "->First, understand the problem and collect relevant data. Then perform EDA, preprocess the data, select a model, train it, evaluate performance, and fine-tune if necessary.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Why do we have to perform EDA before fitting a model to the data?  \n",
        "\n",
        "->EDA helps understand the structure, patterns, missing values, and relationships in the data, which is important for choosing the right preprocessing steps and model.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What is correlation?  \n",
        "\n",
        "->Correlation measures the relationship between two variables and how they move together. It ranges from -1 to +1.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What does negative correlation mean?\n",
        "\n",
        "->Negative correlation means that as one variable increases, the other decreases.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. How can you find correlation between variables in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "->You can use the `.corr()` function on a DataFrame in Pandas or use Seaborn’s heatmap to visualize correlations.\n",

        "17. What is causation? Explain difference between correlation and causation with an example.\n",
        "\n",
        "->Causation means one variable directly affects another. Correlation just means they change together.  \n",
        "Example: Ice cream sales and drowning rates may be correlated but ice cream doesn’t cause drowning. Both rise due to hot weather.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is an Optimizer? What are different types of optimizers? Explain each with an example.  \n",
